   Description of PEAS

**PEAS** is a framework used in Artificial Intelligence to describe the task environment of an intelligent agent. It helps in understanding **what an agent should do**, **where it works**, **how it acts**, and **what it can sense**.

PEAS stands for:

* **P – Performance Measure**
* **E – Environment**
* **A – Actuators**
* **S – Sensors**

The PEAS description is mainly used to design **rational agents** by clearly defining their goals and capabilities.

 PEAS Description for Soccer Game Agent

**Performance Measure**

The performance measure defines how the success of the soccer agent is evaluated.
For a soccer game agent, the performance is measured by:

* Scoring maximum goals
* Preventing goals by the opponent
* Maintaining ball possession
* Making accurate passes
* Winning the match

### **Environment**

The environment is the surroundings in which the agent operates.
For a soccer agent, the environment includes:

* Soccer field
* Ball
* Teammates
* Opponents
* Goal posts
* Referee

**Actuators**

Actuators are the actions that the agent can perform to interact with the environment.
The soccer agent uses actuators to:

* Move forward and backward
* Turn left or right
* Kick the ball
* Pass the ball
* Defend against opponents

Sensors**

Sensors allow the agent to perceive information from the environment.
The soccer agent uses sensors to detect:

* Position of the ball
* Position of teammates
* Position of opponents
* Location of goal post
* Game status
